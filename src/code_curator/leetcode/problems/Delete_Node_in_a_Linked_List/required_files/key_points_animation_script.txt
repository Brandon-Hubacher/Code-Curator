<key_point_1>
Write a function to delete a node in a singly linked list.
You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly. The constraints are listed below. The number of nodes in the given list is in the range 2 to 100 inclusive
The nodeâ€™s value is greater than or equal to negative 100 and less than or equal to positive 100

The

The value of each node in the list is unique And the node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node
