  # explain_constraint_two: The second constraint states that a node's value ranges from negative one thousand to positive 1000 inclusive. The value of numbers are bounded usually because the # solution to the problem would cause underflow or overflow. So, this could be a hint that the solution involves arithmetic.
  # explain_constraint_three: The third constraint states that the value of each node in the list is unique. I can see this being relevant if we were given the value of the node to be removed rather than the node itself. If that were the case, and not all values were unique, then which node to delete could be unclear. However, that is not the case, so the constraint seems irrelevant.
