57.5  58.0  node
58.0  58.5  Ok
58.5  59.0  now
59.0  59.5  that
59.5  60.0  we’ve
60.0  60.5  been
60.5  61.0  introduced
61.0  61.5  to
61.5  62.0  the
62.0  62.5  problem
62.5  63.0  let’s
63.0  63.5  try
63.5  64.0  to
64.0  64.5  understand
64.5  65.0  the
65.0  65.5  problem
65.5  66.0  constraints
66.0  66.5  because
66.5  67.0  they
67.0  67.5  can
67.5  68.0  often
68.0  68.5  provide
68.5  69.0  insight
69.0  69.5  about
69.5  70.0  the
70.0  70.5  solution.
70.5  71.0  At
71.0  71.5  first
71.5  72.0  glance
72.0  72.5  the
72.5  73.0  first
73.0  73.5  constraint
73.5  74.0  may
74.0  74.5  seem
74.5  75.0  quite
75.0  75.5  strange.
75.5  76.0  Why
76.0  76.5  is
76.5  77.0  the
77.0  77.5  lower
77.5  78.0  bound
78.0  78.5  2?
78.5  79.0  Is
79.0  79.5  there
79.5  80.0  something
80.0  80.5  special
80.5  81.0  about
81.0  81.5  2?
81.5  82.0  Well
82.0  82.5  if
82.5  83.0  we
83.0  83.5  consider
83.5  84.0  all
84.0  84.5  the
84.5  85.0  information
85.0  85.5  about
85.5  86.0  the
86.0  86.5  problem
86.5  87.0  we
87.0  87.5  can
87.5  88.0  see
88.0  88.5  that
88.5  89.0  this
89.0  89.5  can
89.5  90.0  actually
90.0  90.5  be
90.5  91.0  derived
91.0  91.5  from
91.5  92.0  the
92.0  92.5  fourth
92.5  93.0  constraint.
93.0  93.5  <pre>Because
93.5  94.0  the
94.0  94.5  node
94.5  95.0  to
95.0  95.5  be
95.5  96.0  deleted
96.0  96.5  is
96.5  97.0  in
97.0  97.5  the
97.5  98.0  list
98.0  98.5  we
98.5  99.0  know
99.0  99.5  there
99.5  100.0  must
100.0  100.5  be
100.5  101.0  at
101.0  101.5  <a>least</a>
101.5  102.0  one
102.0  102.5  node.
102.5  103.0  And
103.0  103.5  when
103.5  104.0  there’s
104.0  104.5  only
104.5  105.0  one
105.0  105.5  node
105.5  106.0  in
106.0  106.5  a
106.5  107.0  list
107.0  107.5  that
107.5  108.0  node
108.0  108.5  is
108.5  109.0  both
109.0  109.5  the
109.5  110.0  <a>head</a>
110.0  110.5  and
110.5  111.0  the
111.0  111.5  tail.
111.5  112.0  But
112.0  112.5  because
112.5  113.0  the
113.0  113.5  node</pre>
113.5  114.0  to
114.0  114.5  be
114.5  115.0  deleted
115.0  115.5  is
115.5  116.0  <during>not</during>
116.0  116.5  the
116.5  117.0  tail
117.0  117.5  there
117.5  118.0  must
118.0  118.5  be
118.5  119.0  at
119.0  119.5  least
119.5  120.0  2
120.0  120.5  nodes
120.5  121.0  in
121.0  121.5  the
121.5  122.0  linked
122.0  122.5  list!
122.5  123.0  I
123.0  123.5  can’t
123.5  124.0  find
124.0  124.5  a
124.5  125.0  similar
125.0  125.5  justification
125.5  126.0  for
126.0  126.5  the
126.5  127.0  upper
127.0  127.5  bound
127.5  128.0  on
128.0  128.5  the
128.5  129.0  number
129.0  129.5  of
129.5  130.0  nodes
130.0  130.5  1000
130.5  131.0  seems
131.0  131.5  arbitrary.
131.5  132.0  The
132.0  132.5  second
132.5  133.0  constraint
133.0  133.5  places
133.5  134.0  limits
134.0  134.5  on
134.5  135.0  a
135.0  135.5  node's
135.5  136.0  value.
136.0  136.5  The
136.5  137.0  typical
137.0  137.5  reason
137.5  138.0  for
138.0  138.5  constraining
138.5  139.0  the
139.0  139.5  size
139.5  140.0  of
140.0  140.5  integers
140.5  141.0  in
141.0  141.5  a
141.5  142.0  problem
142.0  142.5  is
142.5  143.0  potential
143.0  143.5  underflow
143.5  144.0  and
144.0  144.5  overflow.
144.5  145.0  But,
145.0  145.5  because
145.5  146.0  there's
146.0  146.5  no
146.5  147.0  arithmetic
147.0  147.5  in
147.5  148.0  this
148.0  148.5  problem,
148.5  149.0  this
149.0  149.5  isn't
149.5  150.0  an
150.0  150.5  issue.
150.5  151.0  So,
151.0  151.5  this
151.5  152.0  isn't
152.0  152.5  a
152.5  153.0  pertinent
153.0  153.5  constraint
153.5  154.0  and
154.0  154.5  it
154.5  155.0  can
155.0  155.5  be
155.5  156.0  disregarded.
156.0  156.5  The
156.5  157.0  third
157.0  157.5  constraint
157.5  158.0  seems
158.0  158.5  weird.
158.5  159.0  Why
159.0  159.5  does
159.5  160.0  it
160.0  160.5  matter
160.5  161.0  that
161.0  161.5  every
161.5  162.0  node
162.0  162.5  be
162.5  163.0  unique?
163.0  163.5  The
163.5  164.0  short
164.0  164.5  answer
164.5  165.0  is,
165.0  165.5  I
165.5  166.0  don't
166.0  166.5  think
166.5  167.0  it
167.0  167.5  does.
167.5  168.0  If
168.0  168.5  we
168.5  169.0  were
169.0  169.5  given
169.5  170.0  the
170.0  170.5  value
170.5  171.0  to
171.0  171.5  be
171.5  172.0  deleted,
172.0  172.5  and
172.5  173.0  not
173.0  173.5  all
173.5  174.0  values
174.0  174.5  in
174.5  175.0  the
175.0  175.5  linked
175.5  176.0  list
176.0  176.5  were
176.5  177.0  unique,
177.0  177.5  then
177.5  178.0  there
178.0  178.5  would
178.5  179.0  be
179.0  179.5  ambiguity
179.5  180.0  about
180.0  180.5  which
180.5  181.0  node
181.0  181.5  to
181.5  182.0  delete.
182.0  182.5  However,
182.5  183.0  we
183.0  183.5  are
183.5  184.0  given
184.0  184.5  the
184.5  185.0  node
185.0  185.5  to
185.5  186.0  be
186.0  186.5  deleted,
186.5  187.0  and
187.0  187.5  so,
187.5  188.0  like
188.0  188.5  the
188.5  189.0  prior
189.0  189.5  constraint,
189.5  190.0  this
190.0  190.5  can
190.5  191.0  be
191.0  191.5  disregarded.
