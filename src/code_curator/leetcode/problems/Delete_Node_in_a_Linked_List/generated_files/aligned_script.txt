37.25  37.42  may
37.42  37.7  seem
37.7  37.94  quite
37.94  38.58  strange

73.54  74.52  but
74.52  74.78  because
74.78  74.9  there's

76.09  76.32  this

76.59  76.65  an
76.65  77.02  issue
77.02  77.74  so
77.74  78.14  this

81.6  81.81  seems
81.81  82.25  weird
82.25  82.75  why
82.75  82.87  does
82.87  82.94  it
82.94  83.2  matter
