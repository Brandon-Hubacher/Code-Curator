Delete Node in a linked list. Ok, so the problem is as follows. Write a function to delete a node in a singly linked list. Here, we have a linked list with pointers p1 and p2, with p1 situated at the head, and p2 at the heads next node. We advance both pointers until p1 reaches the node before the node to be removed. Then, move p2 one more node so that p1 and p2 sandwich the node to be removed. Now, take p1s next pointer and set it equal to p2. We have now effectively removed the node from the linked ist. Return everything to normal. is in the list and is not a tail node ok now that we've
