Delete Node in a Linked list

<statement_header>
Ok, so the problem is as follows

<statement>
Write a function to delete a node in a singly linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.

<constraints_header>
The constraints are listed below

<constraints>
The number of nodes in the given list is in the range 2 to 100 inclusive
The node’s value is greater than or equal to negative 100 and less than or equal to positive 100
The value of each node in the list is unique
And the node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node
</Present_Problem>

<intro>
Ok, now that we’ve been introduced to the problem, let’s try to understand the problem constraints, because they can often provide insight about the solution.

<constraint_1>
At first glance, the first constraint may seem quite strange. Why is the lower bound 2? Is there something special about 2? Well, if we consider all the information about the problem, we can see that this can actually be derived from the fourth constraint. <pre>Because the node to be deleted is in the list, we know there must be at <a>least</a> one node. And, when there’s only one node in a list, that node is both the <a>head</a> and the tail. But, because the node</pre> to be deleted is <during>not</during> the tail, there must be at least 2 nodes in the linked list! I can’t find a similar justification for the upper bound on the number of nodes, 1000 seems arbitrary.

<constraint_2>
The second constraint places limits on a node’s value. The typical reason for constraining the size of integers in a problem is potential underflow and overflow. But, because there’s no arithmetic in this problem, this isn’t an issue. So, this <a>isn’t</a> a pertinent constraint and it can be disregarded.

<constraint_3>
The third constraint seems weird. Why does it matter that every node be unique? The short answer is, I don’t think it does. <pre>If we were given the value to be deleted, and not all values in the linked list were unique, <a>then</a> there would be ambiguity about which node to delete.</pre> However, we are given the node to be deleted, and so, like the prior constraint, this <a>can</a> be disregarded.

<constraint_4>
Ok now the fourth constraint is intriguing. The second part at least. The first part about the node to be deleted being in the list isn’t striking because it’s intuitive that you can’t remove a node that’s not present. That isn’t to say this isn’t important and that you should assume the node exists though. It’s certainly an edge case that could show up if you’re asked this in an interview and you should absolutely ask your interviewer. Ok, with that out of the way, let’s think about why we’re guaranteed the node to be deleted isn’t the tail. Why not the head? Or the third node? What is so special about the tail? Unfortunately, we’ll have to explore this later in the video, because there’s some stuff I’d like to explain first.
